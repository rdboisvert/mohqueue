Need to handle situation when call terminates when REFER in process.

Find available MOH files and offer these only.

Before accepting MOH Queue 1) check URI of MOH queues, 2) mohdir.

Use URI comparison routine when checking if URI matches.

Find out why URI wrong when build SIP msg from buffer.

Accept-Language should be what is sent in INVITE.

Document /etc/shorewall/rules changes.
