Check URI of MOH queues before accepting.

Use URI comparison routine when checking if URI matches.

Use a locking mechanism to prevent overlap problems when dealing with
messages.

Keep track of call counts in queue records.

Find out why URI wrong when build SIP msg from buffer.

Accept-Language should be what is sent in INVITE.

Need to handle BYE before final NOTIFY on REFER.

Document /etc/shorewall/rules changes.

ACCEPT  fw      all     udp     -       9010:9099
